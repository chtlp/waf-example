This is a sample project to demonstrate using waf to build C++ projects.

The main app is in app/main.cpp. Support classes are in directories foo and bar.

To build, download and put the waf executable file in the top-level directory,
then run "./waf configure" followed by "./waf".

There is some Python-related stuff in the top-level wscript but it's not used
anywhere, but you could use it when building with 'pyext' feature.
